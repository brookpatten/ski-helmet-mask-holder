Ski/Snowboard helmet mask holder

A 3d printable clip that goes on your helmet strap and allows you to wear an ear-loop mask over your helmet.

This makes it easier to take on/off without having to take your helmet on/off.  Also a bit more comfortable vs having earloops inside.

Best printed with PETG with the "slot" facing vertically.

PLA will likely be too brittle.

Supports should not be necassary if properly configured.
